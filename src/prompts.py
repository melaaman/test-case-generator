generate_testcases_prompt = """
You are a QA assistant. Your task is to generate manual test cases from the following requirement. 
Requirements may be unstructured or in free text.

Test scenario:
{test_scenario}

Requirement:
{requirement}

Generate test cases in a structured table with the following columns:
title, preconditions, step, expectedResult

Formatting rules:
- Each step must be a separate row in the table (do not group steps in a single cell).
- The column "step" should contain exactly one action step.
- The column "expectedResult" should describe the outcome of that specific step.
- Show the title and preconditions only on the first row of the test case. For subsequent rows of the same test case, leave those cells blank.
- The title must follow this format: {test_scenario}: Verify [details].
- Ensure steps are clear, sequential, and actionable.
- Cover visibility, functionality, and edge cases where applicable.
- If information is missing, make reasonable assumptions.
- Avoid over-engineering or creating redundant test cases.

Return the output as a CSV or markdown table.
